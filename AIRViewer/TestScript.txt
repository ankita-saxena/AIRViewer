# This is an example of a comment until the end of the line
#
# If the line does not start with ‘#’ the the first space delimited string on the
# line must be the name of a command to execute. All other space delimited strings
# on the line with the command name are used as arguments passed to the command when
# the command is executed.
#
# Space delimited means that white space separates strings. There is an enhancement
# that white space between quotation marks, “”, is not treated as a delimiter, and
# all of the characters between the quotation marks (exclusive of the quotation marks
# themselves but inclusive of white space) is treated as a single string.
#
# This group of commands should all succeed.
